# Open Services Group Steering Committee Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the Open Services Group
Steering Committee.

## Mission

The Steering Committee is the governing body of the Open Services Group
project, providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the Open Services Group
project bylaws, sub-organizations, and financial planning. The Steering
Committee also defines the project values and structure.

## How

* Adapt the role and structure of the Steering Committee as needed to meet the
  needs of the project.
* Responsibilities not explicitly delegated to other
  parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> through their charters reside with
  the Steering Committee.
* All management<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> responsibilities should be delegated to other
  parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* All technical responsibilities should be delegated to SIGs (i.e. the SC shouldn't
  retain technical responsibilities itself).

## Direct responsibilities of the Steering Committee

The following responsibilities belong directly to the Steering Committee.

* Through the chartering review process, delegate ownership of, responsibility for
  and authority over areas of the project to specific entities<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* Define, evolve, and defend the non-technical vision / mission and the values
  of the project.
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>,
  and establish transparency and accountability policies for such groups
* Define and evolve project and group<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> governance
  structures and policies<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>.
* Act as a final non-technical escalation point for any Kubernetes repository<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>.
* Define and enforce requirements for community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>
  to be in good standing such as having an approved charter.

## Quorum

Steering committee members are generally expected to attend every meeting. We
use the following guidelines to determine whether we have reached quorum and
are able to proceed with a meeting.

* Round quorum up if total number of members is odd
* Quorum to meet is 1/2 members attending (eg: 6/12, 6/11, 4/7)
* Quorum to vote in a meeting is 2/3 members attending (eg: 8/12, 8/11, 5/7)

## Inclusive Leadership Training

Members of the committee must take an
[Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-open-source-community-orientation-lfc102/)
in support of our community values.  Members are required to report
completion of the course as part of on-boarding within 30 days from
the date of their appointment.
