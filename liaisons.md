# Liaisons

Each community group in Kubernetes is assigned a Steering Committee
liaison. Liaisons act as a point of contact from steering, engage with
their respective community groups to ensure they are healthy and
facilitate communication.

Liaisons do not make decisions for the community group or on behalf of
the Steering Committee.

Liaisons are assigned community groups at random (adjustments can be
made, if needed) with each member having an (almost) equal distribution
of SIGs, WGs and UGs.
